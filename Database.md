# Database Schema

The **Sintel Database** contains the following collections and fields:

## Experiment

An **Experiment** is associated with a Dataset, a subset of its Signals and a Template,
and represents a collection of Dataruns, executions of Pipelines generated from the Experiment
Template over its Signals Set.

### Fields

* `_id (ObjectID)`: Unique Identifier of this Experiment object

* `created_by (String)`: Identifier of the user that created this Experiment Object
* `insert_time (DateTime)`: Time when this Experiment Object was inserted

## Datarun

The **Datarun** objects represent single executions of an **Experiment**,
and contain all the information about the environment and context where this execution
took place, which potentially allows to later on reproduce the results in a new environment.

It also contains information about whether the execution was successful or not, when it started
and ended, and the number of events that were found in this experiment.

### Fields

* `_id (ObjectID)`: Unique Identifier of this Datarun object
* `experiment_id (ObjectID - Foreign Key)`: Unique Identifier of the Experiment
* `pipeline_id (ObjectID - Foreign Key)`: Unique Identifier of the Pipeline used
* `start_time (DateTime)`: When the execution started
* `end_time (DateTime)`: When the execution ended
* `software_versions (List of Strings)`: version of each python dependency installed in the
  *virtualenv* when the execution took place
* `budget_type (String)`: Type of budget used (time or number of iterations)
* `budget_amount (Integer)`: Budget amount
* `num_events (Integer)`: Number of events detected during this Datarun execution
* `status (String)`: Whether the Datarun is still running, finished successfully or failed
* `insert_time (DateTime)`: Time when this Datarun Object was inserted

## Signalrun

The **Signalrun** objects represent single executions of a **Pipeline**Â on a **Signal** within a
Datarun.

It contains information about whether the execution was successful or not, when it started
and ended, the number of events that were found by the Pipeline, and where the model and
metrics are stored.

### Fields

* `_id (ObjectID)`: Unique Identifier of this Datarun object
* `datarun_id (ObjectID - Foreign Key)`: Unique Identifier of the Datarun to which this Signalrun belongs
* `signal_id (ObjectID - Foreign Key)`: Unique Identifier of the Signal used
* `start_time (DateTime)`: When the execution started
* `end_time (DateTime)`: When the execution ended
* `model_location (String)`: URI of the fitted model
* `metrics_location (String)`: URI of the metrics
* `num_revents (Integer)`: Number of events detected during this Signalrun execution
* `status (String)`: Whether the Signalrun is still running, finished successfully or failed
* `insert_time (DateTime)`: Time when this Datarun Object was inserted

## Event

Each one of the anomalies detected by the pipelines is stored as an **Event**, which
contains the details about the start time, the stop time and the severity score.

### Fields

* `_id (ObjectID)`: Unique Identifier of this Event object
* `signalrun_id (ObjectID - Foreign Key)`: Unique Identifier of the Signalrun during which this
Event was detected.
* `signal_id (ObjectID - Foreign Key)`: Unique Identifier of the Signal to which this Event relates
* `start_time (Integer)`: Timestamp where the anomalous interval starts
* `stop_time (Integer)`: Timestamp where the anomalous interval ends
* `severity (Float)`: Severity score given by the pipeline to this Event
* `source (String)`: `ORION`, `SHAPE_MATCHING`, or `MANUALLY_CREATED`
* `num_annotations (int)`: Number of Annotation associated to this Event.
* `insert_time (DateTime)`: Time when this Event Object was inserted

## Event Interaction

The **Event Interaction** collection records all the interaction history related to events.

### Fields

* `_id (ObjectID)`: Unique Identifier of this Interaction object
* `event_id (ObjectID)`: Unique Identifier of the Event to which this event relates
* `action (String)`: Action type performed on this event, such as delete, split, and adjust
* `start_time (Integer)`: Timestamp where the anomalous interval starts
* `stop_time (Integer)`: Timestamp where the anomalous interval ends
* `created_by (String)`: Identifier of the user who interacted with the target Object
* `insert_time (DateTime)`: Time when this Event Interaction Object was inserted

## Annotation

Each Event can have multiple **Annotations**, from one or more users.
**Annotations** are expected to be inserted by the domain experts after the Datarun has
finished and they analyze the results.

### Fields

* `_id (ObjectID)`: Unique Identifier of this Comment object
* `event_id (ObjectID - Foreign Key)`: Unique Identifier of the Event to which this Annotation relates
* `tag (String)`: User given tag for this event
